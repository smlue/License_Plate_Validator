# License_Plate_Validator
The function implemented verifies the validity for a Czech license plate and differentiates the type of license plate. This is either regular, electrical, or custom. License plates for special vehicles, persons with diplomatic privileges, historical and sports vehicles, etc. are not distinguished and thus fall under the invalid license plates.
